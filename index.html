			<p style="text-align: center;"> 
			The NBA GOAT argument has been a contentious topic for years. Michael Jordan, perhaps? LeBron James? Even, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?These three individuals are recognized as the greatest basketball players in the course of time. They are and were the most potent players in each of their periods, while others might even argue that they were the greatest players during those eras. In the 1970s, Kareem played. LeBron in the 2010s and Jordan in the 1990s. 
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;"> 
			Nowadays, however, we are not focusing on the phenomenal individuals they are; instead, we are considering a variety of aspects, such as standard and advanced statistics, accolades, their impact on the sport, their talent level, and the challenges that each of their eras presented.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;"> 
		    We will be looking at Player efficiency rating, points per game, gamescore rating, as well as individual accolades to determine who is, once and for all, the GOAT of Basketball.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;"> 
            The accolades will rely on MVPs, Finals MVPs, NBA Championships, as well as All-NBA Team and Defensive accolades. The way to determine the best individual is through Points Per Game, Player efficiency rating, and GameScore.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">
			Each league leader will gain 50 points, 2nd will get 40, 3rd will get 30, the player with the most points will win the GOAT debate.
